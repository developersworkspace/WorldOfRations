# World of Rations Pty Ltd.

World of Rations is an online cloud-based ration formulation program, structured in such a way as to suit the farmer, specialist nutritionist, feed milling companies and academics alike. The program formulates rations in a true least-cost linear programming procedure. The user merely has to select from the extensive list of feedstuffs the feeds available to him and submit the cost of the selected ingredients. Along with the standard ‘production- type’ species, World of Rations offers to its users the facility to formulate rations for a very wide range of other animals such as dogs, cats, alpacas, ostriches, quail, fish, antelope, etc. The nutrient requirements for all these animals are derived from the latest publications of the major scientific councils such as NRC, ARC, AAFCO etc, and form part of its extensive data base , making it unnecessary to users to have these values at their fingertips. There is the added facility offered for users to modify or change the values of any particular formula or feed ingredient, if he so wishes. And finally, we will be adding a new feature (to appear soon) where users can choose the trace mineral compound they prefer to use that needs to be included in the supplement premix that will rectify any deficiencies found in the initial formulation.
